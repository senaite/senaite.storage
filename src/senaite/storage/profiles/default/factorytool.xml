<!-- This import step informs the portal_factory tool that we want it to manage
  our content types. This tool deals with the fact that in Archetypes and most
  CMF types, the object is actually created before the first edit form is filled
  in. That is, there are no true "add forms".
  The factory tool creates a temporary object in lieu of an "add form", and then
  moves the object to the proper location after it has been successfully saved.
  This is only needed for Archetypes content types. It makes sure when you
  start adding a content item but don’t finish it, that no half created item
  lingers.
