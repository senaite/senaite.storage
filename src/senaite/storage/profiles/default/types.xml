<!-- This adds content types in the portal_types tool. The meta_type can be:
  - "Dexterity FTI": for Dexterity content. This is probably what you want.
  - "Factory-based Type Information with dynamic views": for Archetypes content
     and for the Plone Site itself
  - "Factory-based Type Information": for Archetypes content that does not need
     dynamic views, the ability to choose a view in the display menu.

  The types.xml should be accompanied by a types folder with details information
  on the new types. If you are editing an already existing type, then types.xml
  is not needed: a file in the types folder is enough.
